PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open source, distributed computing framework and set of libraries for real-time, large-scale data processing.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging the capabilities of PySpark for processing large-scale datasets. Using PySpark, we perform data transformations and execute Spark SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from a comprehensive dataset of bird species.

## Dataset Description
The dataset, 'birds.csv', comprises various attributes related to bird species, including 'class id', 'filepaths', 'labels', 'data set', and 'scientific name'. The dataset is substantial in size, making it a fitting choice for demonstrating PySpark's data processing capabilities.

## Data Processing and Analysis

### Transformation
Data transformation involves filtering the dataset to focus on specific categories and performing group-by operations. Key transformations include:

* Filtering: Records are filtered to isolate specific bird categories, for instance, 'ZEBRA DOVE'.
* Aggregation: The dataset is aggregated to calculate the average class id for each bird label, offering insights into the distribution of class identifiers across species.

## Spark SQL Query
A Spark SQL query is implemented to further analyze the dataset:

* The query performs a group-by operation on bird labels to count the number of occurrences of each label, providing a clear view of the dataset's composition regarding bird species.

## Visualizations
Visualizations created as part of this project provide a graphical representation of our findings, making the data more accessible and understandable. These visualizations are included in the summary report and are also saved as image files within the repository.
